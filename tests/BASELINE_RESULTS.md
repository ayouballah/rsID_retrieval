# Test Results - Pre-Cleanup Baseline

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** PASSED  
**Total Tests:** 19  
**Failures:** 0  
**Errors:** 0  
**Execution Time:** 0.088s

## Test Coverage Summary

### VCF Validation (4 tests)
- Valid VCF file validation
- Nonexistent file handling
- Invalid file extension detection
- Empty file detection

### Sandbox Processor (11 tests)
- Simple equation validation
- Complex equation validation
- Empty equation rejection
- Invalid syntax detection
- Wrong variable detection
- Negative result prevention
- RefSeq chromosome formatting
- UCSC chromosome formatting
- Ensembl chromosome formatting
- Numeric chromosome formatting
- Sex chromosome formatting (X, Y)

### Integration Tests (4 tests)
- Basic VCF modification workflow
- Format conversion during modification
- Invalid VCF rejection
- Invalid equation rejection

## Notes

These smoke tests establish a baseline before repository cleanup. All core functionality is working correctly:

1. VCF Processing - File validation working properly
2. Equation Validation - All edge cases handled correctly
3. Chromosome Formatting - Universal format support confirmed
4. Integration - End-to-end workflows functional

## Next Steps

With this safety net in place, we can proceed with:
1. Repository cleanup and reorganization
2. File archiving and removal
3. Directory restructuring

After cleanup, re-run these tests to ensure nothing broke during reorganization.

## How to Re-run

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

This baseline confirms the tool is stable and ready for cleanup.
