# Changes Made: Emoji Removal and Progress Bar Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Emoji Removal
Removed all emojis (✅, ❌, ⚠️) from console output messages in the following functions:

- `fetch_rsid_entrez()` - Removed emojis from rsID lookup messages
- `process_norsid_entries()` - Removed emojis from processing messages
- `annotate_vcf_with_ncbi()` - Removed emojis from API status messages
- `clean_vcf()` - Removed emojis from cleaning status messages
- `validate_and_prepare_vcf()` - Removed emojis from validation messages

### 2. Progress Bar Improvements for CLI

Updated the progress handling to use tqdm progress bars for command-line interface while preserving GUI progress callbacks:

#### Functions Updated:
- `annotate_vcf_with_entrez_only()`
- `process_norsid_entries()`

#### Implementation:
- Added CLI mode detection: `is_cli_mode = progress_callback is None or (hasattr(progress_callback, '__name__') and progress_callback.__name__ == '<lambda>')`
- For CLI mode: Uses tqdm progress bars for better user experience
- For GUI mode: Continues to use the existing progress callback system
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

### 3. Dependencies
- Ensured `tqdm` package is properly installed and imported
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Benefits

1. **Clean Console Output**: Removed unnecessary emoji clutter from messages
2. **Better CLI Experience**: Proper progress bars with percentage, time estimates, and speed
3. **Maintained GUI Support**: GUI progress bars still work as before
4. **Professional Appearance**: Console output looks more professional and clean

## Testing

- Command-line interface tested and working correctly
- GUI compatibility maintained
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Error handling remains robust

## Files Modified

- `rsID_retrieval.py` - Main changes for emoji removal and progress improvements
- Added `test_changes.py` - Test script to verify changes work correctly

All changes maintain backward compatibility and improve user experience without affecting core functionality.
